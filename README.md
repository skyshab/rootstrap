# Rootstrap: a WordPress Development Toolkit

Rootstrap is a collection of utilities for managing WordPress Customizer controls, settings, responsive breakpoints and styles. 

## Requirements

* WordPress 4.9.6+.
* PHP 5.6+ (7.0+ recommended).
* [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) for managing PHP dependencies.


## Features

Rootstrap is a collection of tools for use when implementing the WordPress Customize API in 
your theme or plugin. Certain project variables can be defined within a config file and utilized 
when creating customizer sections and controls or rendering out the related styles.

* Devices

  In the WordPress customizer, there are three device buttons for the Customize Preview, 
  mobile, tablet and desktop. Rootstrap devices lets you easily register new devices to 
  the Cusomtizer Control bar, and set the minimum and maximum screen widths for each device. 

* Screens

  Screens represent the responsive breakpoints that a website uses to determine when 
  changes occur with layouts, components and other styles. Screens are generated from
  the registered devices into all possible combinations, but custom screens can also
  be defined. Screens can then have styles associated with them and output when needed. 

* Styles

  Styles for customizer settings can be created cleanly within PHP, organized by screen, 
  and stored in a variable or echoed out when needed. Each style can be associated with a Screen, 
  and all styles of each screen will be output together in a single media query. There is also a
  javascript api for controlling responsive styles in the customize preview.

* Customizer defaults

  Define the default values for customizer controls in the Rootstrap config file. The initial 
  values will be set in the customizer. Styles for these values can be output automatically 
  so that the settings match the way the site displays. Use cases would be setting the default 
  theme styles, or child theme styles. 

* Post Customizer

  The Post Customizer will check the post meta for matching Customizer setting ids. If found, 
  the post values will supercede the customizer settings. This functionality can be enabled 
  on any post types, but is set to posts only by default.

* Customizer Section Tabs 

  Allows you to create a tabbed interface within sections in the customizer control panel, 
 with the ption to add a preview device trigger when opening a tab. 

* Customizer Section Sequences 

  Allows you to add a navigation bar with arrow navigation to the top of customizer sections. 
  Has options to show or hide the sections in the panel, reverse the order of the navigation, display 
  prev/next labels, and add a preview device trigger.
